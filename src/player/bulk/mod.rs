//! Offline build of a prod-like personal explorer database, for benchmarks
//! (milestone 4 of `player-explorer.md`):
//!
//! 1. `population`: game counts of all players, and a selection of players
//!    (the `requests.tsv` players and a sample of others).
//! 2. `scatter`: one pass over the parquet that writes the games of the
//!    selected players, as records of the `games` column family, to
//!    partitions by user hash.
//! 3. `build`: per partition, the games up to a cutoff per player as
//!    sorted, non-overlapping SST files of all column families (the same
//!    aggregation and placement as a rebuild), to ingest into the bottom
//!    level. The games after the cutoffs that are to be indexed by the
//!    aging step go to tail files, by the time of the visit that indexes
//!    them.
//! 4. `age`: the tails through the live write path (`write_chunk`,
//!    rebuilds), interleaved in time order across players.
//!
//! Records are synthesized with the rules of the mock lila
//! ([`crate::mock_lila::synth`]), so that the database agrees with what the
//! mock serves for the same players.
