# lila-openingexplorer v4

Next generation opening explorer for lichess.org, indexing billions of
chess games (currently ~10 billion rated games across all variants,
and growing).

## Usage

Build the binaries:

```sh
cargo build --release
B=target/release
```

Production: 128 GiB RAM, 12 hardware threads, SST files on hard disks,
two instances running intermittently.

Create the database directories from the SST files. The SST files are
hard-linked, so they must be on the same file system as the database:

```sh
$B/explorer ingest --db /hdd/lichess/db --games /hdd/lichess/sst/games --positions /hdd/lichess/sst
$B/explorer ingest --db /hdd/masters/db --games /hdd/masters/sst/games --positions /hdd/masters/sst --game-ids /hdd/masters/sst/game_ids
```

Serve them:

```sh
$B/explorer lichess --db /hdd/lichess/db --bind 127.0.0.1:9002 --cors \
    --cache 32g \
    --blocking-threads 16 \
    --response-cache 300000 \
    --lila-bearer-file /etc/explorer-bearer

$B/explorer masters --db /hdd/masters/db --bind 127.0.0.1:9003 --cors \
    --cache 4g \
    --blocking-threads 12
```

* `--cache`: Should fit index and filter blocks (10.2 GiB as of 2026-11,
  growing with the number of games). Adding more is good, but keep a
  significant amount of RAM for the page cache to avoid cold starts.
* No `--direct-reads`: Avoid when cold starts matter. Otherwise good combined
  with assigning all RAM to `--cache`.
* `--blocking-threads 16`: To be measured. On hard disks, it might be good
  to oversubscribe.
* `--response-cache 100000`: 28% hit rate in 2026-11. More gains little.
* `--lila-bearer-file`: Token of https://lichess.org/@/OpeningExplorer
  (or `EXPLORER_BEARER_FILE`), for the blacklist of players marked by
  moderators every `--blacklist-refresh` seconds, default 173 min.
  `--no-blacklist` to disable.
* `--admin-bind`: Provide `/monitor`.

The personal opening explorer (`/player`) has its own writable database,
created on first start, and indexes games from lila on demand:

```sh
$B/explorer player --db /nvme/player/db --bind 127.0.0.1:9004 --cors \
    --db-path /nvme/player/sst:64g --db-path /hdd/player/sst:6t \
    --cache 8g \
    --lila-bearer-file /etc/explorer-bearer
```

* `--db-path`: The write ahead log (in `--db`), then multiple paths and
  their capacities (to put the upper levels on fast storage, if possible).
* `--rate-limit 16m` (default): Bounds write throughput per second of
  compactions.
* `--admin-bind`: Provide `/monitor` and `DELETE /player/{id}`.
* `--indexers 8` (default): Parallel index runs, which is also the most
  parallel streams from lila's games export. Uses `--lila-bearer-file`
  if specified.

Replay an nginx request log (tab separated `$msec`, `$status`,
`$request_time`, `$upstream_response_time`, `$request_uri`) against both:

```sh
$B/stress_explorer samples/requests/explorer-2026-11-06T1520Z-1h.tsv.zst \
    --lichess-url http://127.0.0.1:9002 \
    --masters-url http://127.0.0.1:9003
```

## Indexing

### What to expect?

Indexing run of ~2.4 TiB input PGNs

| Step | Time | Peak RSS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pgn_to_parquet` | 2 h 08 min | 28 GiB |
| `parquet_to_positions` (3 passes, `--scratch-budget 2863g`) | 2 h 40 min | 80 GiB |
| `parquet_to_games` | 15 min | 2 GiB |
| `ingest` | 8 s | |

on this development hardware:

* AMD Ryzen 9 9950X (16 cores, 32 threads), `--threads 30`
* 192 GiB RAM, `--memory-budget 100g`
* Input PGNs on HDD readable at ~330 MiB/s sequential
* Output and scratch space on 7.3 TiB NVMe, sustaining ~2.6 GiB/s reads +
  2.7 GiB/s writes concurrently.

### `pgn_to_parquet`

Prepare a parquet file from PGNs for further processing.

**Input:** ~2.4 TiB of monthly game dumps from https://database.lichess.org \
**Output:** ~470 GiB parquet file \
**Typical bottleneck:** sequential reads of the dumps (from HDDs) > CPU

Inputs must be in chronological order by month.

Example:

```sh
pgns=$(ls samples/lichess_db/*/lichess_db_*_rated_*.pgn.zst | awk -F_ '{print $NF, $0}' | sort -s -k1,1 | cut -d' ' -f2)
$B/pgn_to_parquet --out lichess/lichess_db_rated.parquet $pgns
```

### `parquet_to_positions`

Scan out position SSTs from the parquet file.

**Input:** ~470 GiB parquet file from above \
**Output:** ~2 TiB of SST files \
**Additional resources:** ideally ~5.5 TiB fast disk scratch space (for a
single pass, ~3 TiB for 2 passes, ~1.8 TiB for 3), ~100 GiB RAM \
**Typical bottleneck:** CPU, because every pass replays all games (~50 min per
pass on the development hardware), scratch space determining the number of
passes > scratch write throughput (a single pass writes ~5 TiB) > memory

Walk the parquet file to produce SSTs indexed by position. Can walk the
parquet multiple times to make do with insufficient scratch space.

Example:

```sh
$B/parquet_to_positions lichess/lichess_db_rated.parquet --out lichess/sst --scratch scratch --scratch-budget 6000g --memory-budget 100g
```

### `parquet_to_games`

Scan out game SSTs

**Input:** ~470 GiB parquet file from above \
**Output:** ~560 GiB of SST files \
**Additional resources:** no scratch space, ~2 GiB RAM \
**Typical bottleneck:** CPU (compression)

```sh
$B/parquet_to_games lichess/lichess_db_rated.parquet --out lichess/sst/games
```
